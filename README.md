# Homebrew Formula Analytics (deprecated)

This tap provided `brew formula-analytics` JSON output for [formulae.brew.sh](https://formulae.brew.sh)'s analytics data.

It has now been moved into [Homebrew/brew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew).

`brew formula-analytics` and `brew generate-analytics-api` still work as before, they just aren't in this tap any more.
